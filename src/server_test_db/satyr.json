Satyrs are very much at home in inns and taverns, sometimes venturing into humanoid settlements (usually in disguise) purely to sample the atmosphere of a particularly famous common room, gaze upon an extremely beautiful person, or taste an especially rich food."

Enchanted woodlands provide shelter and safety, as well as the companionship of other fey creatures, thus most satyrs make their homes in small, hidden villages. Others are more solitary, retreating to some secluded hermitage to perfect a piece of music or recover after a particularly intense festival."
